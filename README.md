Brief description

A portfolio of work is prepared to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. An effective portfolio highlights the strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 
Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

Acceptance criteria

The webpage will meet the following criteria expected by potential employer,
-	Viewing the portfolio’s webpages, I find developer’s name, self-photo, and links to sections about himself, his work and contact details
-	Click one of the links in nav-bar, it scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer’s project
-	When viewing developer’s first project, I find the project image appears larger in size than other images
-	Clicking images of each projects will take me to the deployed applications
-	Resizing the page to view on different screens and devices, I’m presented with responsive layout that adapts to the viewport


Responsive Layout Setting for Different Screen Size

All elements on the page are arranged in a series of rows when viewport size is 768px or wider, displaying the header, nav-bar and each sub-sections in a normal way, 
as shown in the following snapshot as example,

When viewport size is reduced to be smaller than 768px, the header and each sub-sections are arranged to stack along a column in the page, allowing the graphics 
and article to be displayed in full blocks, as shown in the following snapshot,
